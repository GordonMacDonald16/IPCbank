Steps:
from cmd line within project directory:
>make
>./dbServer

launch a second instance of terminal and run the interest.c process:
>./interest

Once the interest process starts counting down, from the dbEditor (in dbServer window) enter:
LOCK

When 60 seconds elapses and the interest calculator attempts to unlock the database it will wait.
Once you want to let the interest process into the database again, from the dbEditor enter:
UNLOCK

This test will also work with locking out an ATM transaction instead of the interest process.
